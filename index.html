                            <h2>About Me</h2>
                            <p>My name is Prabhjot Kaur, and I am a passionate student of Interactive Media Design . I am dedicated to blending creativity with technology to craft engaging and impactful digital experiences. My journey in this field is driven by a deep interest in both the artistic and technical aspects of media design.<br> </br>

                                As a student, I have developed a strong foundation in design principles, user experience (UX), and user interface (UI) design. My coursework and projects have equipped me with hands-on experience in various design software and tools, allowing me to create visually appealing and user-friendly digital products. Whether it's graphic design, web development, or multimedia production, I am always excited to take on new challenges and push the boundaries of my creativity.
                                
                                One of the aspects I value most about my education is the opportunity to collaborate with peers and mentors. I thrive in team settings where the exchange of ideas leads to innovative solutions and compelling designs. My portfolio reflects this collaborative spirit, showcasing a diverse range of projects from dynamic websites and mobile applications to immersive multimedia presentations and interactive installations.
                                
                                Being from Punjab, I am deeply connected to my cultural roots. I draw inspiration from my rich heritage and often incorporate cultural elements into my work, creating designs that resonate with a wide audience. This cultural perspective not only enriches my creations but also helps me produce more inclusive and relatable media content.</p>
